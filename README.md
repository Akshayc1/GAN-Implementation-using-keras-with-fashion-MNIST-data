Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs, are an architecture for training generative models, such as deep convolutional neural networks for generating images.

GANs consists of two ANN or CNN models:

1. Generator Model: Used to generate new images which look like real images.
2. Discriminator Model: Used to classify images as real or fake.
